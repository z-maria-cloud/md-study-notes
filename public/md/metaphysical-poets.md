# Metaphysical poets

- A group of 17th-century English poets
- Their work was characterised by the use of conceits
	- The use of apparently unconnected ideas and things that force the reader to think through the argument of the poem
	- An example of metaphysical conceit can be found in John Donne's "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning", in which a couple faced with absence from each other is likened to the legs of a compass

## John Donne

- John Donne was born in 1571
- His style is characterised by various paradoxes, ironies, tense syntax and his tough eloquence → some were adaptations of European baroque techniques
- He is the greatest of the English Metaphysical poets
- He wrote love lyrics, religious verse and treatises
- His secular poetry is direct, witty, and imaginative

### Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions

- The Devotions is an example of 17th-century devotional writing
- The poem is about death, rebirth and the early modern concept of sickness as a visit from God, reflecting internal sinfulness
- Donne wrote the poem after recovering from a serious illness – probably relapsing fever or typhus
- Having come close to death, he described his thoughts throughout his recovery
- The poem is divided into 23 parts, each consisting of 3 sub-sections
- The 23 sections are chronologically ordered, each covering the author's thoughts and reflections on a single day of the illness
- The 17th devotion includes the phrase "No man is an island"

## Andrew Marvell

- He was born in 1621
- He was an English metaphysical poet, satirist and politician

### To His Coy Mistress

- It is considered one of Marvell's finest works
- It is possibly the best recognised *carpe diem* poem ("carpe diem" is usually translated to "seize the day")
- The speaker of the poem addresses a woman who has been slow to respond to his romantic advances
	- He could spend centuries admiring her
	- The woman's resistance to his advances (i.e., coyness) does not discourage him
	- The speaker laments how short human life is
	- The speaker urges the woman to requite his efforts: by loving one another, they will both make the most of the brief time they have to live
