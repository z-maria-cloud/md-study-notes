# Morality Plays

- Morality plays are a genre of medieval and early Tudor drama
- Morality plays feature personified concepts (virtues or vices, sometimes even practices or habits) as well as angels and demons, who try to persuade a protagonist, who represents a generic human being, toward either good or evil
- The common story arc of these plays follows "the temptation, fall and redemption of the protagonist"
- Morality plays remind the audience to meditate upon their relationship with God
- All of the morality plays are written in rhymed verses

## Everyman

- Everyman is a late 15th-century morality play by an anonymous English author, printed around 1530
- The play deals with the theme of Christian salvation: Man must have a relationship with God in order to reach salvation
- The story makes use of allegorical characters
- To develop a relationship with God and attain salvation, Man's strength, wisdom, senses, and discretion are not helpful
- The relationship with God is strengthened through adherence to rules that prepare Man to eternal salvation. These rules were established by the Church:
	- The partaking of the Eucharist
	- Confession
	- Penance
	- Participation in rites

### Summary
